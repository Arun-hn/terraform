 overview of the steps you've taken in setting up an AWS EKS cluster using Terraform:

1. Provider Configuration (provider.tf):
Configured the AWS provider with the desired region and provided AWS access and secret keys.
2. VPC and Subnet Setup (vpc.tf, internet_gateway.tf, subnets.tf):
Defined a VPC with necessary attributes such as CIDR block, DNS support, and DNS hostnames.
Created an internet gateway and attached it to the VPC.
Set up public and private subnets with associated CIDR blocks and availability zones.
3. Route Tables (route_tables.tf):
Created public and private route tables.
Defined routes within the route tables to route traffic accordingly.
4. Route Table Associations (route_table_associations.tf):
Associated the route tables with their respective subnets.
5. Elastic IP Addresses and NAT Gateways (elastic_ip.tf):
Allocated Elastic IP addresses for NAT gateways.
Created NAT gateways associated with specific public subnets.
6. IAM Roles for EKS Cluster and Nodes (eks_cluster.tf, eks_node_group.tf):
Defined an IAM role for the EKS cluster with the necessary assume role policy.
Attached the "AmazonEKSClusterPolicy" to the EKS cluster IAM role.
Created an IAM role for EKS nodes with policies required for worker nodes and attached them.
Configured an EKS node group associated with the EKS cluster.
7. EKS Cluster (eks_cluster.tf):
Configured and created the EKS cluster with a specified version.
Specified VPC configurations, including public access to the EKS API server endpoint and associated subnets.
8. Outputs (outputs.tf):
Defined outputs for key information about the EKS cluster, such as the endpoint and certificate authority data for kubeconfig.
9. Kubeconfig Configuration:
Leveraged Terraform outputs to configure kubectl with the necessary information to connect to the EKS cluster.
10. Overview:
Established a robust network infrastructure with public and private subnets, internet access, and NAT gateways.
Configured IAM roles to grant necessary permissions for EKS cluster and worker nodes.
Successfully created an EKS cluster with associated node groups.
Obtained important information, such as the EKS cluster endpoint and certificate authority data, for connecting to the cluster.
