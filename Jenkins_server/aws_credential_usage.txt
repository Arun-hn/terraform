When using AWS credentials for use with Terraform on GitHub, it's essential to follow security 
best practices to protect your sensitive information. 

Set Environment Variables Locally:

Open your terminal or command prompt.
Set the following environment variables with your AWS credentials:
	export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key-id"
	export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-access-key"

Reference Environment Variables in Terraform:
	In your Terraform scripts, reference the environment variables for AWS credentials:
	provider "aws" {
 	region = "us-west-2"
	}
